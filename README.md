### Mahz Alam: Features #3 & #7

### Paulo Burgess: Features #2 & #6
#### Feature 2
For feature two when a user of type Owner logs into the system it will allow them
to create a Customer Profile. Once Customer profiles are created the Owner user will then be able
to search for different customer profiles using their ID's or names. They will also be able to see
a full list of Customer Profiles. They can also delete or update any customer profiles. Deleting a customer
profile will also cause the system to delete all linked invoices linked to that profile.
 *NOTE * Feature 7 was not implemented, so I needed to test this feature using sample Invoices it was hard coded in. The hard coded
file is called "customerInvoicesTest.csv" you can edit the ID in there to match the ID of any customer to ensure that it deletes it
*NOTE END *
#### Feature 6
For feature 6 when a salesperson user logs into the System they will be able to create a
customer order for a customer profile. It will allow them to add 1-5 items to an order for a specific order
and choose need by dates for all of the items they select as well as the quantity they need. It will automatically update the quantity on hand
of that item.
